# Development Environment

I used android studio to create the app and run the emulator.

Everything is created in Java. Some of the libraries I used was Intent, and Random.


# Future Work

* Get the intent to grab the information sent.
* Include pictures for different combinations.
* Create an actual story for the backgrounds.
